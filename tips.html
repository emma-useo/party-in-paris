  <h2>How to dress for a night out in Paris ? </h2>
  <p>
    <br> Paris, for all of its elegance, fashion and haute couture, is actually a surprisingly casual city. Do not hesitate to leave your heels at home and don’t worry about going out in your jeans and sneakers.</br>

     <br>A real no-no however, is shorts and flip flops, which will get you turned away from most places no matter how good the weather is. In winter, don’t forget to bundle up with a coat; Parisians are always well-wrapped up and drinking on a terrace is popular all year round :)</br>

    <br><u><b>Perfect outfit to go to bars:</b></u> dressed-up casual with a casual jean and a nice top.</br>

    <br><u><b>Perfect outfit to go to nightclub:</b></u> Dark or black jean or a dress with a nice blouse.</br>

  <p>
    <br><u>Bar are always free,</u> and many Parisians happily stay out late just drinking in their favorite local bars, or go dancing in bars with a dance floor area.</br>

     <br> We recommend you to enjoy happy hours at the beginning of the night ! </br>

     <br> Nightclubs usually charge between €5 to €10 for entry.</br>

  <h2>How to go back home in Paris ? </h2>

  <p>
   <br> You can use the <u><b>public transport </u></b>(bus, metro). We recommend you to download the RATP plan on you smartphone, which is free, to have all the necessary information. Also check metro opening and closing hours before going out. Be careful, metro opening and closing change according to the fay of the week !</br>

   <br>You can also use <u><b>taxi drivers or some plateforme as Uber, Bolt, Kapten</u></b> that you can order directly through an application on your phone.</br>

  <h2> How to be safe going out in Paris ? </h2>
  <p>
   <br> When possible, only go out <u><b> within a group that you know well</u></b> and in which you trust</br>.

   <br> Always <u><b>stay in control when drinking alcohol</u></b>. Keep a close eye on your drinks and never leave them unattended at any point.</br>

   <u><b>Don’t advertise your mobile phone to people on the street</u></b> - keep them hidden. Ideally, leave valuables such as jewellery at home, but if you must take them out with you then keep them safely hidden.</br>

   <u><b>Don’t be a hero on a night out</u></b>. If there is a fight or an argument stay out of it and get help from bouncers or the police.</br>
